      <h2>Biography:</h2>

      <div>

        <p>I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College. I have an interest in computer related subjects like cyber security, computer hardware and computer software. I also have some experience in video editing and photography, however, those are mostly just hobbies that I do. The major that I'm going for is cyber security and networking, but specifically I would want to work as a network administrator. They design, and build networks for organizations, as well as install configure and maintain computer infrastructure such as routers, switches, and cables. I believe this is interesting as well and would like to pursue a future in this career. </p>

      <h2>An Exerpt from Sherlock Holmes</h2>

      <div>
        <p>"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."</p>

        <p>Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."</p>
        
        <p>"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"</p>
        
        <p>"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</p>
        
        <p>"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."</p>
        
        <p>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.</p>
        
        <p>"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."</p>
        
        <p>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.</p>
